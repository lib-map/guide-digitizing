## Introduction
Digitizing allows image data to be converted to vector digital data. This is accomplished by manually digitizing objects by tracing lines or adding points based on the source media. 

## *[Digitizing in ArcGIS Pro]*

#### Starting a New Project

1. To begin a new project, open ArcGIS on your desktop.
2. Click **Map** under *New, Blank Templates*.

3. Name the project and choose a file location that will be easy to access. Then click **OK**. A new world map should open. 

#### Adding Files
Now that a new project has been created, a folder connection must be added to import data. 
1. To do this, click **Add Folder** under the *Insert* tab of the toolbar to create a folder connection.

4. Locate desired data. Right click the file and click **Add to Current Map**. The selected file is now added to the project and should appear in the *Contents* pane. It is okay if the raster is not displayed on the map as long as the file is visible in the Contents pane.
